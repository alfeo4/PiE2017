# This is an example components file.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
#
# This file contains the data on the optical system.
# Currently 2 types of component are allowed. A Medium (length, refractive index)
# and a refractive Surface (radius of curvature, 0 if flat).
#
# A components file will be generated from a lenses file or it can be used
# directly (this is called advanced mode). To use it, save this file as 
# 'components.txt' and edit it to your liking.
#
# Example system:
#
Medium 1 1
Surface 0
Medium 1 1.5
