# This is an example lenses file.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
#
# This file is used to define a simple optical system. 
# Allowed entries are Medium (length, refractive index) and
# Lens (focal length in air, refractive index). 
#
# Lens entries in this file will automatically be converted to a 
# symmetrical lens, with the given refractive index. If different
# lens types are desired, edit the generated components file directly.
# To use this file, save it as 'lenses.txt' 
# and edit it to your liking.
#
# Example system:

Medium 1 1
Lens 0.5 1.5
Medium 1 1
